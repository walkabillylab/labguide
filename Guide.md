## Welcome

Welcome to the Walkabilly lab. Great to have you. Below you will find lots of information and readings about the lab. Take some time to read the linked documents and get oriented. If you have questions don't hesitate to ask. 

Our vision is  

> A physically active Canadian population

Our mission is  

> To conduct research that will help design urban environments that equitably increase physical activity for the entire population

Our motto is  

> "On se dit les vraies choses" [Marianne Beaulieu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianne-beaulieu-4b358866). The quote is from one of my dear friends and PhD colleagues. 

Which I translate to mean

> We provide positive critcism and work honestly to do the best possible research. 

## First Tasks

Your first tasks in the Lab are to complete the three following online training sessions. Each is approximately 1 hour in length and required in order to access data. 

1. Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS 2)
[https://tcps2core.ca/welcome](https://tcps2core.ca/welcome)   
2. CIHR Sex and Gender in the Analysis of Data from Human Participants
[http://www.cihr-irsc-igh-isfh.ca/course/index.php](http://www.cihr-irsc-igh-isfh.ca/course/index.php) 
3. Introduction to Health Equity [https://learn.nccdh.ca/](https://learn.nccdh.ca/)

## Introductory Readings

Below are some introductory readings. Please take the time to read. We are a team and teams work better when they work with a common framework. The readings are a start.

1. Markowetz, 2015. You Are Not Working for Me; I Am Working with You. PLOS Computational Biology, 11(9): e1004387 [http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004387](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004387)

3. Liboiron, 2017. How to run a feminist science lab meeting[https://civiclaboratory.nl/2017/03/31/how-to-run-a-feminist-science-lab-meeting/](https://civiclaboratory.nl/2017/03/31/how-to-run-a-feminist-science-lab-meeting/)
    + Everything except the Myers-Briggs junk!

3. Kearns and Gardiner, 2011. The care and maintenance of your advisor. Nature, 469(570) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7331/full/nj7331-570a.html](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7331/full/nj7331-570a.html)

## Work Themes

We have a number of themes we try and adhere to in the lab. These should reflect your personal style and preferences. *I stole these from the internet*.

* Success depends on participation – share ideas, ask questions, draw others out
* Use I statements
* Speak honestly
* Critique ideas, not people
* Remember responsibility and non-defensiveness
* Choose to be present
* Staying on schedule is everyone’s responsibility; honor time limits
* Let go of the outcome
* Have fun!

## Hit by a bus

My father in law is a old wizened lawyer who trains new lawyers on managing their practice. He talks about the **hit by the bus test**. The basic setup for the test is, *if you were hit by a bus this afternoon, someone new, who has never seen your work, should be able to find all your documents and pick up where you left off, within a day*. This is crucial for **reproducbility and transparency**. There are lots of tools to help with this, but the most important tool is to be able to articulate the system you use to ensure you can pass the hit by a bus test. 

Here are some quick readings about reproducibility

* Simply Statistics Blog, The Real Reason Reproducibility is important[http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/)

## Population Health Perspective

We have a broad public health perspective in the lab. This means that even if you are coding, doing a systematic review, or doing advanced stats, you should try and keep the population health perspective in mind. What is the population health perspective? Here are some readings: 

1. Rose G. 2001. Sick individuals and sick populations. International Journal of Epidemiology, 30(3),427-432. [https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/30.3.427](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/30.3.427)
2. Hawe P, Potvin L. 2009. What is population health intervention research? Canadian Journal of Public Health. 100(1),1. [http://journal.cpha.ca/index.php/cjph/article/view/1748](http://journal.cpha.ca/index.php/cjph/article/view/1748)
3. Fuller D, Buote R, Stanley K. 2017. A glossary for big data in population and public health: discussion and commentary on terminology and research methods. Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health. 71:1113-1117. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2017-209608](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2017-209608)  

## Systems

The most important part of a system is being able to articulate that system. If you can't describe your system, you don't have a system. [Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco) has some great blog posts about academic writing, productivity, and being a nice person. I recommend the following few blog posts.

1. Improving your academic writing: My top 10 tips. [http://www.raulpacheco.org/2013/02/improving-your-academic-writing-my-top-10-tips/](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2013/02/improving-your-academic-writing-my-top-10-tips/)
2. 8 sequential steps to write a research paper from start to finish.[http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/04/8-tips-to-write-a-research-paper-from-start-to-finish-relatively-quick-and-easy/](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/04/8-tips-to-write-a-research-paper-from-start-to-finish-relatively-quick-and-easy/)

**Key features are**  

* It takes time  
* Organize before you verbal diarrhea  
* Use software to your advantage  

## Get Social

If you are not on Twitter, I highly recommend you join the Twitter academic community. It's fun and allows you to interact with top researchers in your field, journals, and your new academic friends. 

Here is a guide from the London School of Economics [PDF download](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/files/2011/11/Published-Twitter_Guide_Sept_2011.pdf) (pitty it's not in html because this link will surely break). Here is another [guide for using Twitter at conferences](http://www.rmmlondon.com/events/a-guide-to-using-twitter-academic-conferences/).

## Weekly Meetings

The team has weekly meetings. At these meetings you will be asked to provide a summary of your work and any questions or concerns you have. Focus the summary of your work on specific asks for the team or unanswered questions. How can we, as a team, contribute to your work or reflection. Are there general concepts we might be able to help with? Are there specific skills that someone could help with? We strive to meet the principles of the [Feminist Lab Meeting](https://civiclaboratory.nl/2017/03/31/how-to-run-a-feminist-science-lab-meeting/). 

## Software

We use a number of different project management and communication software in the lab. If you want to get a head start you can familiarize yourself with:  

1. [Slack](https://slack.com/)
2. [Trello](https://trello.com/)
