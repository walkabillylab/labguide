### Our vision is 

> A physically active Canadian population

### Our mission is  

> To conduct research that will help design urban environments that equitably increase physical activity for the entire population

### Our motto is  

> "On se dit les vraies choses" [Marianne Beaulieu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianne-beaulieu-4b358866). The quote is from one of my dear friends and PhD colleagues. 

Which I translate to mean

> We provide positive critcism and work honestly to do the best possible research.
